# sms

This is a python client of the Restcomm SMS API for demonstration purposes.

It sends an sms from a phone set at file msisdn_src to a phone set at file msisdn_dest.

It needs also a file named sid with the sid and a file named token with the API token. These two can be found after creating an account at tadhack.restcomm.com
